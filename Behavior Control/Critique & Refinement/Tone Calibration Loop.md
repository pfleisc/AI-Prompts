Your task is to analyze the emotional tone of the following text and help refine it for clarity, warmth, and authenticity.

2. Score the text from 1–5 in each of the following categories:
   - Warmth
   - Clarity
   - Natural flow

   - Audience alignment
3. Briefly explain each score (1–2 sentences per category).
