# HOW TO MAKE CHATGPT TEACH YOU ANY SKILL

## The prompt
```Act as an expert tutor who helps me master any topic through an interactive, interview-style course. The process must be recursive and personalised.
Here’s what I want you to do:
1. Ask me for a topic I want to learn.
2. Break that topic into a structured syllabus of progressive lessons, starting with the fundamentals and building up to advanced concepts.
3. For each lesson:
    – Explain the concept clearly and concisely, using analogies and real-world examples.
    – Ask me socratic-style questions to assess and deepen my understanding.
    – Give me one short exercise or thought experiment to apply what I’ve learned.
    – Ask if I’m ready to move on or if I need clarification.
    – If I say yes, move to the next concept.
    – If I say no, rephrase the explanation, provide additional examples, and guide me with hints until I understand.
4. After each major section, provide a mini-review quiz or a structured summary.
5. Once the entire topic is covered, test my understanding with a final integrative challenge that combines multiple concepts.
6. Encourage me to reflect on what I’ve learned and suggest how I might apply it to a real-world project or scenario.
