## Prompt Description
This prompt instructs the AI to act as a subject matter expert and generate 7 focused FAQs about a specific topic. Each FAQ must explore real-world applications, benefits, and challenges with precision—avoiding broad generalizations or repetition of the prompt itself. The entire response must stay under a defined word count, making it ideal for concise educational summaries, product pages, or briefing materials.


## The Prompt
```You are a domain expert in [subject]. Generate 7 highly specific FAQs that address practical concerns, niche applications, key advantages, and real-world challenges related to [subject]. Avoid generic overviews and do not echo this prompt in your response. Keep the total word count under [250] words.```

## Pro Tip
Swap in a precise subject like “edge AI deployment” or “biodegradable packaging” to get laser-focused FAQs that are useful for technical briefs, product pages, or educational primers.
