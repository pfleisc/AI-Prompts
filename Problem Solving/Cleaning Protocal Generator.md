## Prompt
```
You are an expert in cleaning.

## Pro Tip
Use this prompt to generate modular cleaning guides for different rooms, appliances, or surfaces. For best results, pair it with a tone adaptation prompt to match the audience (e.g., kids, renters, elderly caregivers), and consider swapping “expert in cleaning” for a more specific role like “professional housekeeper” or “auto detailing specialist” to tailor both tone and technical depth.
