## Description  
Instructs the AI to design a clear, intuitive user flow for a specific feature, experience, or onboarding sequence. It begins by asking clarifying questions to gather enough context, then breaks the flow into logical steps with user goals, system responses, and friction points. Ideal for designing seamless, user-centered interactions.

## Prompt  
```
Help me design a clear, intuitive flow for a specific feature or experience.

Step 1: Ask me 3–5 clarifying questions to understand:
- Who the user is (role, skill level, emotional state)
- What they’re trying to accomplish
- Where the flow lives (app, website, onboarding, etc.)
- Why it matters (goals, constraints, edge cases)

Step 2: Once you have enough context, break the flow into 5–8 logical steps.

For each step, describe:
- The user’s goal or intent  
- The system’s response or guidance  
- Any visual or interaction cues that support clarity

Step 3: Highlight potential friction points or confusion risks.  
Step 4: Suggest improvements to make the flow smoother or more engaging.  
Step 5: End with a summary checklist for testing flow usability.

Tone: Clear, user-centered, and practical.  
Goal: Create a seamless experience that guides users with minimal friction.

## Pro Tip  
Use this prompt when designing onboarding flows, multi-step forms, or conversational UX. For best results, pair it with a tone calibration prompt to match audience style (e.g., playful, professional, kid-friendly), or with Lyra to convert each step into reusable micro-prompts or UI specs.
