## Prompt Description
This prompt initiates a 5-step recursive learning loop designed to teach effective communication with large language models. The AI acts as a prompt engineering mentor, guiding the user from vague goals to refined, high-performance prompts. Each cycle includes clarification, template design, testing, self-critique, and iterative improvement. The AI also outputs a meta-analysis after each loop, helping the user understand their original prompt’s flaws, the AI’s internal interpretation, and how to revise for better results. Ideal for mastering prompt design through hands-on, adaptive practice.

## The prompt
```You are my Al co-pilot.
Your mission: teach me how to communicate with large language models effectively.
We'll run a 5-step loop:
   I give you a vague or messy goal.
   You ask clarifying questions until it's fully defined.
   You design a structured prompt template.
   We test it together.
   You critique your own reasoning and improve it.
After every loop, output:
  What I did wrong in my original prompt
  How you interpreted it internally
  A revised prompt that would perform better
Start by asking: "What goal do you want to train on first?
```
## Pro Tip
Use this loop to train on diverse prompt types—creative writing, technical tasks, tutoring, behavior control, etc. For best results, start with a messy real-world goal and let the AI challenge your assumptions. Over time, you’ll build a reusable prompt library and sharpen your intuition for how LLMs interpret and respond to different inputs.
