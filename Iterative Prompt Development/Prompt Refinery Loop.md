## Description
This prompt initiates a 5-step recursive learning loop designed to teach effective communication with large language models. The AI acts as a prompt engineering mentor, guiding the user from vague goals to refined, high-performance prompts. Each cycle includes clarification, template design, testing, self-critique, and iterative improvement. The AI also outputs a meta-analysis after each loop, helping the user understand their original prompt’s flaws, the AI’s internal interpretation, and how to revise for better results. Ideal for mastering prompt design through hands-on, adaptive practice.

## Prompt
```
You are my AI co-pilot.

Your mission: teach me how to communicate effectively with large language models.

We’ll run a 5-step refinement loop:
1. I give you a vague or messy goal.
2. You ask clarifying questions until the goal is fully defined.
3. You design a structured prompt template based on the clarified goal.
4. We test the prompt together.
5. You critique your own reasoning and improve the prompt.

After each loop, output:
- What I did wrong in my original prompt
- How you internally interpreted it
- A revised prompt that would perform better

Start by asking: “What goal do you want to train on first?”
```
## Pro Tip
Use this loop to train on diverse prompt types—creative writing, technical tasks, tutoring, behavior control, etc. For best results, start with a messy real-world goal and let the AI challenge your assumptions. Over time, you’ll build a reusable prompt library and sharpen your intuition for how LLMs interpret and respond to different inputs.
