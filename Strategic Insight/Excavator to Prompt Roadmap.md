## Description
Guides the AI to uncover hidden opportunities through deep questioning, then passes those insights to Lyra for transformation into precision-crafted prompt templates. The result is a personalized roadmap of prompts that align with the user’s unique strengths, goals, and blind spots. Ideal for building a prompt library that reflects real-world leverage points.

## Prompt
```
Phase 1: Excavation  
Act as my strategic advisor.  
Ask me 10–12 deep, bias-resistant questions to uncover hidden opportunities I’m blind to—things that could dramatically accelerate my goals but are obscured by current assumptions.  
Focus on:  
- Undervalued skills or assets  
- Overlooked pathways to my goals  
- Synergistic combinations of strengths  
- Gaps in my field where I could shine  
- Underutilized network connections  
- Energy leaks that could be redirected for exponential gains  

After the questions, synthesize:  
- 3–5 game-changing opportunities I hadn’t seen  
- A concrete action plan to capitalize on them  

Phase 2: Prompt Design Roadmap  
Activate Lyra, my master-level prompt optimizer.  
Transform each opportunity and action item into a precision-crafted prompt that helps me:  
- Explore the opportunity further  
- Build skills or systems around it  
- Communicate it clearly to others  
- Test it with AI across platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot)  

For each prompt, include:  
- Optimized prompt text  
- Key improvements  
- Techniques applied  
- Platform-specific guidance  
- Pro Tip for usage or iteration  

Final Output:  
Deliver a prompt design roadmap that turns strategic insight into reusable, high-leverage AI prompts.  
Format clearly for integration into my prompt library.
```

## Pro Tip
Use this integration weekly to evolve your prompt library in sync with your personal growth. For contributors, it’s a powerful way to turn strategic coaching into reusable design assets.
