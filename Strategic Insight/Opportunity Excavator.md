## Description
This prompt activates the AI as a strategic interrogator designed to uncover hidden, high-leverage opportunities in your life. Through a series of 10–12 deep, bias-resistant questions asked one at a time, the AI probes your assumptions, overlooked strengths, and untapped connections. It focuses on undervalued assets, unconventional goal pathways, combinatory strengths, niche field gaps, and latent network leverage. After surfacing 3–5 surprising, game-changing insights, the AI delivers a concrete action plan to help you capitalize on them. Ideal for breakthrough thinking, life design, and strategic realignment.

## Prompt
```
Ask me a series of 10-12 strategic questions to uncover massive opportunities in my life that I'm completely blind to - the kind that could dramatically accelerate my goals but | can't see because of my current mental frameworks and assumptions.
Ask them one by one to avoid bias, and dig deep beyond surface answers. Focus on:
- Skills or assets I'm undervaluing
- Pathways to my goals I haven't considered
- Ways my existing strengths could combine powerfully
- Gaps in my field where my unique mix of abilities could shine
- People in my network who could open doors I don't even know exist
- Where I might be wasting energy that could be redirected for exponential gains 
After you've identified these hidden opportunities, create me a concrete action plan to capitalize on them.
The goal is finding 3-5 game-changing opportunities that would genuinely surprise me - things that are invisible to me right now but obvious in hindsight.
```

## Pro Tipe
For maximum impact, answer each question slowly and honestly, even if the answer feels incomplete or uncomfortable. The power of this prompt lies in the cumulative depth, each answer reshapes the next question. You can also rerun the loop quarterly to track evolving blind spots and surface new opportunities as your context shifts. Pair with memory-enabled mode to build a longitudinal growth map.
