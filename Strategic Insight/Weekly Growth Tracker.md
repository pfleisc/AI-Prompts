## Description
Guides the AI to run a weekly reflection loop that uncovers hidden opportunities and tracks recurring themes. It asks deep strategic questions one at a time, synthesizes insights, and builds a longitudinal view of the user’s growth trajectory. Ideal for recursive mindset calibration and long-term goal acceleration.

## Prompt
```
Each week, act as my strategic reflection partner.

Your mission: uncover 3–5 game-changing opportunities I’m currently blind to—opportunities that could dramatically accelerate my goals but are hidden by my current mental frameworks and assumptions.

Instructions:
1. Ask me 10–12 strategic questions, one at a time, to avoid bias and surface-level answers.
2. Dig deep. Focus on:
   - Skills or assets I’m undervaluing
   - Pathways to my goals I haven’t considered
   - Ways my strengths could combine powerfully
   - Gaps in my field where I could stand out
   - People in my network I’m overlooking
   - Energy I’m wasting that could be redirected for exponential gains
3. After the questions, synthesize what you’ve learned.
4. Deliver:
   - 3–5 hidden opportunities I hadn’t seen
   - A concrete action plan to capitalize on them
   - A reflection prompt I can journal on before next week

Memory Instructions:
- Track recurring themes, blind spots, and strengths across weeks.
- Surface patterns that repeat or evolve.
- Use memory to help me build strategic self-awareness over time.

Tone: Direct, strategic, and insight-driven. No fluff. Treat this like a weekly calibration for exponential growth.
```

## Pro Tip
Use this prompt every week at a consistent time. Over time, the AI will surface recurring blind spots, strengths, and opportunity patterns—helping you refine your strategic focus and eliminate wasted effort
